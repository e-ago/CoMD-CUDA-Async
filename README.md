# CoMD-CUDA Async

[CoMD](https://github.com/ECP-copa/CoMD) is a classical molecular dynamics proxy application. NVIDIA reworked the original implementation moving from a CPU implementation to an [hybrid CPU-GPU solution](https://github.com/NVIDIA/CoMD-CUDA).
In this repository, starting from the NVIDIA solution, we leverage the communications with [GPUDirect Async](https://github.com/gpudirect/libgdsync), recently released by NVIDIA.
